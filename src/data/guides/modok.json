Periodically fluctuate up and down between +0 and +120% Attack Rating, plus all the following other attributes:   \n*Up to +777 Block Proficiency so Block and Auto-Block reduces more damage. \n*Up to +1226 Critical Damage so Critical Hits deal more damage. \n*Up to +80% Power Rate to generate more Power from Attacks. \n*Up to +25% Ability Accuracy, increasing the chance for any ability to trigger.",
    "note": "Force Field: Start the fight with 1 Force Field charge, each Auto-Blocking an attack with +174 Block Proficiency. Force Fields cannot trigger Parry. Once depleted, Force Field charges replenish after 7 second(s). This cooldown is reduced by 0.8s for each “alive” Champion on the enemy team. The A.I.M. Synergy with Taskmaster reduces this even further. As long as a Force Field charge is active, opponents’ Power Gain Rate is reduced by up to 100% based on Flux. Power Gain Rate governs abilities that generate Power outside of Attacking, such as those of Doctor Strange, Vision, Hyperion, or the Mystic Dispersion Mastery."

      "note": "Enemy abilities that grant Power or Health are reversed for the duration of this attack. Up to 150% of what they would have gained is lost instead. This amount stacks with the Power Gain Rate reduced by Flux, so performing a Special 1 at max Flux can easily drain Champions like Vision or Doctor Strange to zero. This effect lasts only about 3 seconds but does not require this attack to hit. This attack does not generate any Power for opponents, so even if they don’t have any Power Gain or Regeneration effects active, you can still sneak it in without worrying about filling their Power Meter.",

This increases to +125% duration (and damage) with the Chair Larceny Synergy Bonus, making the total damage output at maximum Flux more than four times greater than when at minimum Flux…just watch out for enemies that can easily deal with Bleed damage.",
