    "description": "And unawakened Scarlet Witch is competent against champions that proc abilities like Armor Up and Regen. Teamed with a Critical Rate boosting team (several combinations provide +14%), Scarlet which has a high chance of achieving Critical Hits, which in turn have a very high chance of nullifying the opponent buff.  \nHer L2 is very strong, but easily blocked or evaded. Your best strategy is to invest in Utility Masteries in order to prolong Stun effects.  Build an L2, parry-stun your opponent, and easily hit them for 5k damage.\n\nAn awakened Scarlet Witch is a whole new game. Critical Hits will now randomly buff Scarlet Witch and randomly debuff the opponent. It is not uncommon for an enemy to be perma-stunned for the duration of a fight."
