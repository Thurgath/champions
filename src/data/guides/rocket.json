  "description": "Ain’t no thing like Rocket ‘cept Rocket – the Keystone Quadrant’s most notoriously cranky fur ball. He’s a master of gadgets with an affinity for heavy weapons, and is always down for a heist, especially if it involves blowing things up. He may be ornery, but he is extremely loyal to his teammates from The Guardians of The Galaxy. Just don’t call him a Raccoon!"
