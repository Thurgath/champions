  "description": "A Master of the Mystic Arts and the current Sorcerer Supreme (through a technicality), Wong is a stoic individual that has devoted his life to protecting the Sanctum Sanctorum using the Mystic Arts of Kamar-Taj, taking on the mantle of his former master, the Ancient One. While his applications of the mystic arts may not be as robust as those of previous Sorcerer Supremes, his vast knowledge and familiarity with tomes and magical relics make him a more than a capable adversary, on and off the battlefield.",

        "name": "Mystic Art Mandalas",
        "description": "Wong’s Tao Mandalas allow him to cast Eldritch Spells. Mandalas cycle: Orange, Green, Blue.\n\nOn Attack: Wong’s Fourth Light Attack will move the active Mandala forward by one.\n\nOn Defense: Wong’s active Mandala will rotate every 8 second(s). This timer is paused during Wong’s Special Attacks.",
        "note": "Wong’s Mystic Art Mandalas are crucial to his gameplay. Because of this, Mandalas change depending on if Wong is on Attack or Defense. Wong has easy access to mode swapping by finishing a Combo with a Light Attack on Attack. While on Defense, Wong’s Mode rotates on a timer which makes it easier to predict which Spell he will cast at any given time."

        "description": "Wong can cast Eldritch Spells, which are Passive and last 14 second(s). Spells can be stacked up to 3 times and are paused during Special Attacks and Wong’s Heavy Attacks.\n\nOrange – Bastion of Balthakk. Wong increases his Physical Resistance by 1083.33 and Wong’s basic attacks give him 1 Eldritch Energy on hit, even through Block.\n\nGreen – Absorption of Watoomb. When Wong deals Energy Damage he instantly Regenerates 2% of damage dealt. When dealt Energy Damage, Regenerate 25% of the damage over 1 second(s) and gain 4 Eldritch Energy. Cannot trigger while still active.\n\nBlue – Virtue of Valtorr. Hitting the Opponent will deal a Burst of 877.6 Energy Damage. Also, whenever the Opponent gains a Buff, Wong will go Unstoppable for 2 second(s) and gain 4 Eldritch Energy.\n\nIf Wong is inflicted by a Wither Debuff with at least one spell active, he will consume up to 1 of each type of spell to Purify the Debuff.",
        "note": "Each Eldritch Spell has a unique purpose, Bastion of Balthakk is useful for almost every fight in the game since Wong requires Eldritch Energy to give him access to his other Special Attacks. Absorption of Watoomb is amazing for fights where Opponents deal a lot of Energy Damage. Finally, Virtue of Valtorr is incredible against Cosmics with a ton of Buffs, granting Wong Eldritch Energy and making him Unstoppable."

        "description": "Wong builds 1 Eldritch Energy every second, except during Special Attacks, doubled against Cosmic Champions. For every Spell active, Wong gains an additional 1 Eldritch Energy per second up to a maximum of 5 per second.\n\nCharging a Heavy Attack grants a Power Gain Passive, generating 175% of a bar of Power per second. This Power Gain consumes Eldritch Energy over time and is removed when Wong runs out of Eldritch Energy or releases his Heavy Attack.\n\nCharging Heavy Attack also grants an Unstoppable Passive for 2 second(s), paused while Charging. 6 second cooldown.\n\nIf Wong gets hit by a Light or Medium Attack while at max Eldritch Energy, he will unleash all Eldritch Energy to deal a burst of 7020.8 Energy Damage. Hitting Wong with a Heavy Attack above 90 Eldritch Energy will remove all of it without unleashing it.",
        "note": "Eldritch Energy is Wong’s primary resource which he builds up over time, allowing him to do absurd amounts of Special Attacks, one after another. Eldritch Energy takes time to build up, so use it wisely or risk not being able to refresh your Spells!"

        "note": "Wong will do anything to protect the Sanctum Sanctorum, even die for it. So if he does, he passes on his Energy to the next Champion that faces the Challenge he did. This Fury and Power Gain greatly benefits Champions that are strong out of the gate, granting quick access to a Special 1 combined with a powerful Fury that can shred through the Opponent’s health bar."

      "note": "Wong’s Special Attacks have 2 different goals. Special Attack 1 is used to build up more Spells, while Special Attack 2 and 3 are used to maintain your currently active Spells.

It lasts 26 second(s) and cannot be removed by Wither, but still counts towards his total Spell count.\n\nWong’s Mastery over the Mystic Arts allows him to instantly Nullify Indestructible and Immortality Buffs on non-Science Opponents, when Nullified, Opponents receive a burst of 514.4 Energy Damage.",
    "note": "Wong’s Signature Ability grants him an instant Spell at the start of the fight, this allows him to counter Cosmic and Energy threats instantly, rather than building up to a Special 1 first. Additionally, the instant Nullification of Immortality and Indestructible Buffs help take down some Cosmic threats."
