  "description": "I know what they say. The son of a Frost Giant. They also called me the god of mischief, but that lacks a certain...imagination. Don't you think? Look at my adoptive family, my father Odin and my brother Thor are so dull, monotonous. Am I good? Evil? Noble? Nonsense. Call me not mischievous â€“ I merely see the world not as it is, but how it could be. Call me a visionary. Call me Loki."
