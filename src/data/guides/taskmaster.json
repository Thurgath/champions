  "description": "Tony Masters was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent exposed to an experimental variant of the Super-Soldier Serum, called the Mnemonic Primer. It grants him the ability to duplicate any movement he sees, but at a cost. The huge amount of information his brain records, causes it to overwrite his own memories, replacing what little remains of his original self. Now known as Taskmaster he offers his skills to the highest bidder as a mercenary and combat trainer.",
