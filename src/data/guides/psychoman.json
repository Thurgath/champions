Obsessed with conquering the normal-sized universe, he crafted a mechanical exoskeleton so he could interact with things not on a microscopic scale. He carries with him the Control Box, a device capable of creating and controlling the emotions of anyone he chooses, especially feelings of Hate, Fear, and Doubt.",

        "description": "Always Active\nThe potency of Psycho-Man’s Concussions are reduced by 25% flat for each unique Buff on the Opponent, up to 3. This cannot reduce them below 0%.\nThe potency of Psycho-Man’s Concussions are increased by 75% flat against Mutants.\nCombat Power Rate is decreased by 10%.\n\nControl Box\nPsycho-Man carries a Control Box with 3 modes: Hate, Fear, and Doubt, flooding his Opponent’s mind with the selected emotion at all times. The Control Box starts in Hate mode.\nWhile fighting as an Attacker, Psycho-Man cycles to the next mode whenever his Fourth Light Attack lands a hit or it strikes into a block.\nWhile fighting as a Defender, Psycho-Man cycles to the next mode when the Opponent fills a Bar of Power. If the Bar was filled during Psycho-Man’s Special Attacks, it cycles after the attack is finished.\nPsycho-Man’s abilities change depending on the current Control Box Mode.\n\nControl Box – Passive\nHate: Opponents fight more aggressively, and suffer Passive Concussion during Heavy Charge and Heavy Attack, reducing Ability Accuracy by -75%.\nFear: Opponents are 70% more likely to use a Special Attack, and suffer Passive Concussion during Special Attacks, reducing Ability Accuracy by -75%.\nDoubt: Opponents fight more defensively, are 70% less likely to use a Special Attack, and suffer Passive Concussion while Blocking, reducing Ability Accuracy by -25%.\n\nControl Box – All Attacks\nHate: Striking the Opponent while they are executing or recovering from a Heavy Charge or Heavy Attack grants Psycho-Man 18% of a Bar of Power.\nFear: Striking the Opponent while they are recovering from a Special Attack grants Psycho-Man 25% of a Bar of Power.\nDoubt: Striking the Opponent while they are Blocking grants Psycho-Man 8% of a Bar of Power.\n\nOpponent activates a Special Attack\nPsycho-Man’s mechanical exoskeleton causes his Opponents to suffer -1400 Critical Rating during their Special Attacks."

Inflict an additional Shock for each Fury Buff on Psycho-Man.\nFear: Inflict the Opponent with a Cowardice Debuff, reducing Special Attack Damage by 40% for 12 second(s).\nDoubt: This attack is Passively Unblockable and inflicts the Opponent with a Power Drain Debuff, depleting 30% of their current Power over 6 second(s).",
            "note": "Using SP1 or SP2 in Hate mode is the way to do the best damage as Psycho-Man, whereas Fear provides utility, and Doubt provides power control. Also, note that additional Shocks are inflicted for each Fury Buff, which especially matters for his SP2."

            "note": "The Fury Buffs from this attack are refreshed whenever Psycho-Man rotates through his modes. So regularly rotating through your modes will allow you to stack multiple Fury Buffs, which in turn means his SP1 will inflict additional Shocks. The Heal Block is also a useful way to get a Heal Block in place for his Signature Ability. Finally, the Special Lock Debuff lets you push the Opponent’s power up without them using a Special Attack, and if you follow this up with the Power Drain on the SP1, it’ll have maximum impact."

Baiting the correct Attacks and getting their abilities to fail due to Concussion will inflict them with Heal Block. If you’re able to do it again while they’re still Heal Blocked, they’ll additionally become Power Locked. Then once they’re in that state, any Power they’d gain from abilities or being struck is funneled into Psycho-Man instead!\nThe Power gain listed in the third point is based around a 5% heal or a Power gain of 25% of a Bar. So if the Opponent were to heal 10% of their max health, Psycho-Man would actually gain twice as much Power as listed here."
