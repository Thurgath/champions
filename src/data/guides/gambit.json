Tech Champions’ Attack Damage counts double for this purpose.\n- While Flak Jacket is active, Gambit gains +1400 Armor Rating and incoming Bleed effects suffer -150% Potency.\n- Against Non-Contact Physical Attacks, the Flak Jacket provides an additional +1400 Armor Rating and Critical Resistance.\n\n\nSpecial Attacks\n- If the opponent does not have an Armor Up BUff, all hits gain +20% Ability Accuracy.",

Gifted with the power to supercharge objects he touches with powerful kinetic force, Gambit now fights alongside his fellow mutants to protect mankind, while also occasionally dipping into his more scoundrel-like nature to pull off a heist here and there."
