    "description": "Spider-Gwen enters the fight in either Hunter Spider or Trap Spider mode.\n\nWhile in Hunter Spider Mode, Gwen focuses her senses to strike at enemy weak points, allowing her attacks a 16% chance to Armor Break foes, lowering their Armor by 4% for 7 seconds. Gwen’s Hunter Spider Mode Armor Break stacks infinitely.\n\nWhile in Trap Spider Mode, Gwen readies herself to ensnare enemies. While charging her Heavy attack, she ignores the first attack against her and gains one charge of Precision, increasing her Critical Hit Rate by 21% for her next attack.\n\n\nSpider-Sense \n- Spider-Gwen begins each fight with 1 charge of Spider-Sense active. Each charge grants +182 Attack Rating and a 7% chance to Evade all incoming attacks. Max: 5 charges.\n- If fighting a Champion of the Superior Class, begin the fight with an additional 3 Spider-Sense charges.\n- When struck 5 times, gain 1 Spider-Sense charge.\n- 100% chance when struck by an opponent with a True Strike Buff to Nullify that Buff and gain a Spider-Sense charge.\n\nEvade Effects\n- When struck by an Unblockable Special Attack, Spider-Gwen ignores the damage. Activating this Ability causes Spider-Gwen to gain +550% Evade Ability Accuracy during the enemy’s Special Attacks for the remainder of the fight.\n- While Blocking, this Champion will not attempt to Evade.\n\n\nEvade an Attack or Land a Combo-Ending Attack\n- Active Hunter-Spider and Trap-Spider effects have their effect duration paused for 0.5 seconds. During Special Attacks, these effects are also paused for the full duration of the attack.",
