  "description": "Dormammu was born to a race of powerful beings made of pure magical energy known as the Faltine, and has only one true desire: power. This desire drove him from his home world and brought him to the Dark Dimension, where he now rules and draws even greater power from the worship of his subjects. Now with the power of so many heroes concentrated in The Contest, Dormammu has come as one of the greatest mystical threats in the universe, undoubtedly to gain that power for himself."
