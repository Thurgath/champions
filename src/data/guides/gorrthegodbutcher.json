  "description": "Gorr the God-Butcher grew up on a harsh world, where belief in the gods kept his people from falling to despair. But after his family perished to the deadly environment, Gorr became disillusioned and swore vengeance against the gods that never came to help him or his people. He later obtained the powerful Necrosword, and gained the ability to control dark magic and shadowy constructs. He uses these powers to wreak havoc, destruction, and death on any and all that would call themselves gods.",

When fighting as a Defender, this also occurs automatically every 10 second(s).\n\nViscera Magic: Inflict Bleed, dealing 1670.8 Direct Damage over 18 second(s).\n\nVenom Magic: Inflict Poison, dealing 1253.1 Direct Damage over 18 second(s) and reducing Regen Rate by 30%.\n\nVolt Magic: Inflict Shock, dealing 2088.5Energy Damage over 18 second(s).\n\nIf any of these Debuffs is prevented via Immunity, Gorr instead inflicts a Degeneration Debuff, dealing 375.93 Direct Damage over 18 second(s). Damage increased by 500% against Tech Champions.\n\nWhile Shadow Magic is active, striking Block has a 4% chance per Buff on Gorr to inflict its matching damaging Debuff, but not Degeneration.",
        "note": "Shadow Magic Buffs are Gorr’s main mechanic. He gets a new one whenever he lands his fourth Light Attack, can stack multiples of all of them, and each one will inflict its corresponding damaging Debuff whenever he lands his second Medium Attack.The Degeneration he triggers has significantly lower damage output, and more so serves to enable other parts of his abilities when fighting Immune champions. However, that lowered damage isn’t the case against #Tech champions, thanks to the 500% damage increase."

        "note": "Gorr’s Regeneration Buff is the first of his mechanics improved by his stacks of Heresy. The second two bullet points here are also very important because they make Gorr more friendly towards the Liquid Courage and Double Edge Masteries.  By repeatedly cycling through his Shadow Magic, he’s able to continually re-trigger this Regeneration Buff and negate the damage taken from those Masteries."

With a little bit of setup and cycling through Shadow Magic, it’s very easy to gain 4 Fury Buffs when using this Attack.

      "note": "The pause effect from Special 3 is useful for building up a significant number of Shadow Magic Buffs in a short period of time. However, its main use is for damage. While the Attack Rating increase might initially seem small, it’s increased for each individual damaging Debuff on the Opponent, further increased for each unique one, and even further increased based on his stacks of Heresy, allowing the number to scale up really quickly."

    "note": "Gorr’s Signature provides him with quite a few different benefits. First, the Undermine Buff allows him to easily attack through Auto-Blocking Opponents, so long as he continually triggers new Shadow Magic Buffs (which he wants to do anyway). The increased duration for damaging Debuffs increases his damage output, and also scales up with his Heresy stacks. Finally, even with only 1 Sig level, he gains a free Heresy stack when fighting on the final node of every quest."

His Special 3 scales up in damage for each one on the Opponent, so his Heavy Attack gives him a once-per-fight way to shortcut his way up to Special 3 and cash in on the damage, rather than having to work his way up to the attack and possibly have some of the Debuffs expire."
