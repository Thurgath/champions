    "description": "All was normal for New York high-school student, Richard Rider until he came into contact with the Nova Corps, a peace-keeping force based on the planet Xandar. After the planet Xandar was invaded and destroyed by a space pirate known as Zorr, the last surviving member of Xandar’s elite Nova Corps, Rhomann Dey, selected Richard Rider to replace him. Rider is given a uniform and powers of a Nova Centurion but little instruction on how to use them. Calling himself Nova, Rider becomes a Super Hero, teaming with other heroes such as Spider-Man and Thor to use his powers for the good of Earth and the universe while serving as its protector.",

            "note": "Opting for this ability while playing Nova gives him considerable utility depending on when this Special Attack is used. Likewise if players fight Nova, this special attack is worth trying to bait out."

            "note": "This does not appear to deal a large amount of damage at first glance, but considering Nova can attain up to 100 Nova Charges, and can increase the base damage of this attack with stacking Fury Buffs, these factors easily multiply into large bursts of Energy Damage."

        "description": "The Human Rocket\n- Nova’s Medium Attacks gain up to 2870.68 Bonus Attack Rating based on the distance travelled in the last executed dash.\n- At 75+ Nova Charges: Nova’s Auto Block triggers the Parry Mastery. This effect cannot interrupt Special Attacks.\n- The duration of Buffs is increased by 80%.",
        "note": "Nova’s Signature Ability highlights the main threats of his abilities while on Attack and on Alliance War Defense. Nova’s Medium Attacks become much more threatening from full-screen with this Signature. Being able to trigger Parry from Nova’s Auto-Block means players need to pay attention to his Nova Charges while fighting against to avoid being Stunned. Once Awakened, Nova is better placed on Alliance War Defense, on nodes with Buffs such as Buff Toggle (Unblockable), (Unstoppable), and Aegis (Intercept)."
