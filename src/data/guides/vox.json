Each Vox is reconstructed out of a brainwashed Inhuman and possesses a deadly collection of their combined abilities. Above all, the Vox’s most dangerous feature is their lack of humanity. They cannot be swayed or tricked or bought, for they want nothing but their enemies’ hearts to stop beating.",

Furies obtained this way cannot exceed 20% of Vox’s base Attack Rating.\n\nCorrupted Buffs have a stack limit of 10 except Intensify, which has a stack limit of 30.\n\nVox’s Medium Attacks grant them a Corrupted Fury Buff with potency 122.95.\n\nVox’s first and fourth Light Attacks grant them a Corrupted Cruelty Buff with potency 42.86.\n\nWhen struck by a Medium Attack, Vox gains a Corrupted Armor Up Buff with potency 110.53.",
