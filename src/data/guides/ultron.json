I am Ultron, created by Stark to bring about peace in our time. But humanity cannot be saved in its current state. No, we need a new world to supplant humanity. A world of metal. I’ll create peace in the only way it can be achieved. Not in Stark’s way, but in my own. How is humanity saved if it’s not allowed to evolve?\"",
