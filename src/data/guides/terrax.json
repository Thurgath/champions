With Terrax’s command over rock and earth now magnified and the Power Cosmic on his side, “Terrax the Tamer” became Galactus’ most ruthless conqueror.",

Terrax gains 10 Attack Charge(s) whenever his attack misses the Opponent. Terrax gains 1 Attack Charge(s) every 0.5 seconds while the Opponent is inside his Rock Field.\n- When Terrax gains 50 Attack Charges he converts them into 1 Power Cosmic. Max 2 per fight.\n- For each Power Cosmic, Terrax gains an additional +10% Power Rate when struck while Indestructible. Max +60%.\n- For each Power Cosmic, Terrax gains an additional +110% Defensive Combat Power Rate when blocking an attack while Indestructible. Max +660%.\n- When Terrax starts a Rock Field, he gains 1 Indestructible Charge Buff for each Power Cosmic. 1 Indestructible Charge is removed each time Terrax is attacked. All remaining Indestructible Charges are removed when the Rock Field expires. Max 10 Indestructible Charges.\n- Terrax’s Indestructible Charge Buffs only ignore damage from attacks and do not ignore damage from Special 3 Attacks.\n\n\nRock Field\n- While the Rock Field is active, Terrax’s attacks gain an additional 3566.6 Attack Rating.\n- While the Rock Field is active, nearby Opponents take up to 881.16 Energy Damage for every second the Rock Field has been active, every 0.5 second(s). This scales with Base Attack only.\n- Every 0.5 second(s) there is a 35% chance to inflict an Armor Break Debuff, reducing the Opponent’s Armor Rating by 525 for 15 second(s). Max 10 stacks.\n- While the Rock Field is active, Terrax is more aggressive.\n\n\nSpecial Attacks\n- Special Attacks cost 100% less power, but after each Special Attack, Terrax’s Power Bar drains until he reaches 0 Power. During this time, Terrax cannot use Special Attacks and his Rock Field is active.\n- Terrax loses power faster the longer his Rock Field has been active."
