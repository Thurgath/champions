  "description": "Iceman aka Robert “Bobby” Drake, was the second, and youngest, member of the original X-men team. His mutant powers give him the ability to radically lower his internal and external temperatures, convert his body into organic ice, and also freeze any moisture in the air around him. When he was temporarily possessed by the powerful telepath Emma Frost she unleashed powers within Bobby far greater than he had accessed himself. Performing new feats such as freezing fluids inside another person’s body, and quickly traveling great distances as a liquid, solid, or gas, Iceman works towards a greater mastery of his powers and there’s no telling where his true limits lie.",
