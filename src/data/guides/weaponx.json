  "description": "Logan became known to the Weapon X program when he joined Team X. While Team X would disband, the Weapon X program was far from finished with him. He would later be the chosen subject for Experiment X, leading to him being captured and taken to a facility near Roanoke, Canada. There, Adamantium was bonded to his skeleton, and his brain was programmed to keep him under control. But after he was “tested” on the population of Roanoke, he was driven into an insane berserk rage by the pain of what he had endured, and what he had been made to do. Breaking free he escaped from the Weapon X program, but though much time has passed, he has never truly recovered from what was done to him by the Weapon X program.",

      "note": "When fighting against Weapon X this special attack is dangerous even if it is dodged because it helps build Rage stacks. Offensively it’s also a way for Weapon X to apply a strong Bleed effect for him to refresh with his Heavy Attack."

      "note": "The SP3 gets Weapon X straight into Berserk Rage. This can be very useful to get back into Berserk Rage after the cooldown ends. It also inflicts the longest Bleed that Weapon X has access to, which makes it the easiest for him to refresh with his Heavy over the rest of the fight."

    "note": "Wolverine (Weapon X)’s Signature Ability is twofold: it gives him greater access to his Berserk Rage mode, which in our opinion is when he’s most fun to play (not to mention most powerful). Secondly, it gives him a Regeneration on fight start, which supports the reckless, berserker playstyle of Weapon X. If he’s not taking at least some damage in the fight, he’s probably not being aggressive enough to make maximum use of his kit.",
