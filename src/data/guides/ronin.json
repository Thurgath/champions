If players take the time to build up another set of Cruelty Passives through Stance switching while this Fury is active, regular Combos become extremely deadly."

        "note": "This Evade comes in handy against Special Attacks that are difficult to avoid. Players can also strategically decide not to activate this Evade by Blocking attacks or using the Dexterity Mastery. If players are feeling lucky, they can intentionally set off this evade to gain a temporary Attack Rating boost."
