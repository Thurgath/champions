  "description": "A founding member of the X-Men, Warren Kenneth Worthington III, was better known as Angel until he was nearly killed, and his wings were brutally amputated. Angel was saved by the ancient and powerful mutant Apocalypse, who transformed him into the horseman Death. Now with blue skin, retractable claws, and razor sharp metallic wings coated with a powerful neurotoxin, he has overcome the programming of Apocalypse, but still continues an inner struggle against his deadly bloodlust as Archangel.",

    "description": "Neurotoxin – Passive\n\nEach time Archangel triggers a Bleed effect on an opponent with an active Poison effect that he caused, they are combined, converting into a Neurotoxin charge lasting 15 seconds.\nNeurotoxins are a Passive effect, and therefore do not count as either a Debuff, or a Poison.\nNeurotoxins do 3444 damage over their duration.\nOn expiry, Neurotoxins have a 100% Chance to Stun their target for 0.5 seconds. This effect will not interrupt a Special Attack.\n\nPassive – Raptor’s Senses\n\nArchangel’s Ability Accuracy cannot be decreased by his opponent’s abilities\n\nPassive – Blood Transmission Vector\n\nEach Bleed Debuff on your opponent increases the chance of any Poison triggering by a flat 25%, and reduces the chance that opponent’s Tenacity abilities will trigger by the same.\n\nBlock – Poison Wings\n\n0% chance to Poison the target, reducing their Health recovery by 30% and dealing 1435 Direct Damage over 15 seconds.\n\nCritical Strikes – Razor Claws\n\n40% chance to cause your opponent to Bleed for 1435 Direct Damage over 15 seconds."
